# Libft - Your First C Library

## Description
**Libft** is a fundamental project at 42 that requires students to re-implement a collection of standard C library functions, as well as additional utility functions.

The goal of this project is to understand the inner workings of these essential functions, learn about memory management, and build a reusable library that will be used in future 42 curriculum projects. This library serves as a personal toolkit, reinforcing the understanding of low-level data manipulation without relying on standard libraries.

### Key Features
* **Libc Functions:** Re-implementation of standard functions like `memset`, `strdup`, `atoi`, etc.
* **String Manipulation:** Custom tools for string processing (`ft_split`, `ft_strjoin`).
* **Linked Lists:** Bonus functions to manipulate lists (`t_list`).

## Instructions

### Compilation
To compile the library, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
make
